    <h1>Mobile application for metasynestheseographic research</h1>
        <p>Proposition for a new research tool</p>
    </div>

<div class="text">

    <p>We are currently developing a method of synestheseography that employs
    an original AR application for mobile devices. It not only facilitates
    existing modes of synestheseographic practice, but also offers a first
    venture into metasynestheseographic studies.</p>

    <h1>Metasynestheseography</h1>

<div class="text">
    <p>New area of research, necessitated by the disappearance of two anonymous
    synestheseographers who experienced strange anomalies at the University of
    Chicago while testing prototypes of the AR app.</p>

    <div class="heading">
    <h1>Account</h1>
    <p>(transcribed from a video feed, filmed via mandatory cameras embedded AR testers' clothing)</p>
    </div>

<div class="text">

    <p>The synestheseographers (henceforth A and B) arrived on campus
    simultaneously, unaware of one anothers' identities.  Upon opening the
    application, the individuals found a message of unknown origin directing
    them to specific floors of the Logan center. Thinking the message was from
    us, they followed the directive: A went to the 1st story of the building, B
    to the 5th. Further messages indicated that the rules of synestheseography
    had changed in this setting. Each floor corresponded to a certain sensation
    (floor 1 was color, floor 2 was texture, etc). Instead of choosing what
    sensation to transmit to their counterparts via the application, A and B
    would limit their attention to the sensation assigned to that floor.
    Furthermore, the direction of their movement was left to their own
    volition; rather than follow the directives of their partners, the
    synestheseographers were told simply to "seek evocative
    manifestations."</p>

    <p>The synestheseographers rapidly discovered that in addition to a
    sensation, each floor had been assigned a "keyword" corresponding to a
    certain surface or set of surfaces. It was unclear whether these surfaces
    were natural to the environment or objects "planted" there by the
    individuals sending the messages, but when their sense descriptions were
    transmitted via the application, the synestheseographers received further
    communcations.</p>

    <p>For example: floor 1, assigned the sensation of color, held a turquoise
    statue. When A touched the statue and transmitted the word "turquoise" to
    the other synestheseographer, he was sent 2 messages:</p>

    <p>1. A new floor assignment<br/>
    2. A fragment of a picture.</p>

    <p>Although unclear what the meaning of the picture was, A entered the
    elevator, where he was given the sensation-assignment of the next floor via
    the application. Both synestheseographers continued in such a fashion for
    some time: traversing floors according to assigned sensations, discovering
    keywords, receiving pictures, and changing levels via the elevator
    "portal."</p>

    <p>After uncovering numerous keywords, both individuals received messages
    directing them to the same central location in Logan. Here, A and B met for
    the first time, and shared the messages they had received with one another.
    They found that the picture fragments they had each been receiving fit
    together to form the image of another room in the building. They entered
    the room, and were assaulted with an overwhelming multitude of sensations.
    On the walls of the room they discovered various symbols, which, when
    viewed through the camera function of the synestheseographic research
    application, revealed bizarre message fragments from a group of
    unidentified individuals we have since labeled
    "metasynestheseographers"...</p>

    <p>At this point, communication with A and B were lost. Both individuals
    seem to have vanished. The only audiovisual record that remains from their
    experience is the following video, apparently corrupted by the
    metasynestheseographers:</p>
