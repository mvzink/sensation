    <h1>Mobile application for metasynestheseographic research</h1>
        <p>Proposition for a new research tool</p>
    </div>

<div class="text">

<p>A recent experimental synestheseographic excursion led to the accidental
discovery of new terrain in synestheseographic research which we call
metasynestheseographic studies. We conceive of a site-specific method of
synestheseography assisted by an original AR application for mobile devices,
enabling new forms of traditional synestheseography while opening paths into
this new research terrain.</p>

<p>The application is described in terms of hypothetical usage based on the
actual research which inspired it.</p>

<p>Two synestheseographers arrive at the Logan Center at a predetermined time.
Through the application, each synestheseographer is assigned a starting floor.
Each floor corresponds to a certain sensation (eg, floor 1 is color, floor 2 is
texture). The synestheseographers traverse their respective floors according to
the rules of synestheseography, but focus only on the sense that floor has been
assigned, transmitting their impressions to the other synestheseographer via
the application. Furthermore, unlike in standard synestheseography, in this
setting the synestheseographer's direction of movement is not determined by the
other synestheseographer's directives, but is a product of their own volition:
synestheseographers should naturally be drawn to surfaces that strike them as
particularly evocative manifestations of their assigned sensation.</p>

<p>In addition to a sensation, each floor is assigned a "keyword" corresponding
to a certain surface or set of surfaces. These surfaces can be either natural
to the environment or objects "planted" there by metasynestheseographic
researchers. The synestheseographers will not be aware that the keywords exist
as they begin the experience, and will never be told what surfaces they are
meant to seek out.</p>

<p>For example, floor 1, assigned the sensation of color, will somewhere hold a
turquoise object that acts as the key. When the synestheseographer transmits
the word "turquoise" to the other synestheseographer, she is sent 2
messages:</p>

<p> 1. a nebulous clue pertaining to a location in the building where some
    message will be conveyed.
    <br />
    2. a new assigned floor.</p>

<p>The synestheseographer then enters the elevator, where she is given the
sensation-assignment of the next floor through the application. The elevator
hence acts as a portal between both the different levels of the building and
the different means of experiencing one's surroundings; each floor is
defamiliarized in a different way as the synestheseographers alter their
outlook according to one particular sensation.</p>

<p>Once the synestheseographers have each traversed a set number of
environments and discovered all the keywords, they are directed to convene at a
central location in the building. Here, they meet each other for the first
time, and together assemble their respective clues, which direct them to
another room in the building.</p>

<p>This room becomes a portal to another space in which the
synes&shy;theseographers are assaulted with various simultaneous sensations,
and must use the mobile application to decode the environment. Along the walls
of the room would be a series of symbols that, when viewed through the camera
function of the app, reveal fragments of a message from the
metasynestheseographic researchers.</p> </div>
