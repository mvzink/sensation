    <h1>Synestheseography and Affect</h1>
    <p>Recent research opens new terrain</p>
    </div>

<div class="text">

    <p>After several months of practice, our senses were finely attuned to the
    minutiae of everyday space: gravel, shattered glass, discarded plastic, the
    grain of a wooden railing-- all called out to us like orphan children
    pleading to be found.</p>

    <p>But something happened. While wandering, mapping, stopping to touch,
    listen, examine, we came across inexplicable surfaces, objects that
    overcame us, overflowing our senses, our rationality, our intuitive
    understanding of our own interior life. Vortexes of vertiginous affect,
    prodding, provoking, gesturing towards something beyond, in excess of our
    intentions, our expectations, even our desires. Another space? Another
    realm of feeling?</p>

    <p>Our cartographies mutated: scattered trajectories gave way to black
    holes, bottomless free-falls, high-velocity affective impacts swirling
    ambiguously through our flesh before finally settling on emotions beyond
    our control.</p>

    <p>Hence, a new synestheseography-- a guided tour of these accidental,
    visceral landmarks ...</p>

        <p>fig. 1: ".... the silver of the can vibrated with amazing energy. I
        was first enticed, next overcome by an inexplicable feeling of
        revulsion. The nausea was so extreme I almost collapsed. I was only
        able to snap a quick photograph before changing course. Perhaps someone
        with a stronger stomach will return to the spot and test their
        sensations against mine..."</p>

        <p>fig. 2: "... I dragged my legs through the leaves. The rustling
        struck something deep within me. Profound nostalgia. Tears welled in my
        eyes. Half formed images of some childhood I never had flashed in my
        memory. I paced back and forth through the leaves, silently weeping,
        for what felt like an eternity. I finally regained my composure and
        tested a nearby pile of leaves for comparison: no emotion, just the
        dry, brittle cracking of organic detritus..."</p>

        <p>fig. 3: "... My fingers made contact with the rough wood of the
        railing. Something surged through me. I felt suddenly sovereign,
        supreme. As if all my inhibitions and self-doubts had melted away in an
        instant. It was more than confidence: it was power. Elated, I nearly
        charged up the stairs and into the stranger's home; the barking of a
        dog sobered my senses and turned me away again..."</p>
