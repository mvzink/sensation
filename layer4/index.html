        <h1>Investigation into fate of disappeared researchers</h1>
    </div>

<div class="text">

    <p> The culmination of our trail in Logan will be a super-charged affective
    space… a ‘tear’ in the Anomal… a qualitative puzzle… an undetermined,
    intersubjective performance… here, the missing researchers, rendered as
    pure sense beings within the field of absolute affect, will communicate
    fragmented messages to the players regarding their disappearance, the
    intentions of the Secret Society, the nature of the Anomal itself… </p>

     <p> As our two players arrive at two separate entrances to Logan, they
     will begin to locate and follow the path that the missing researchers took
     through the building. When a player locates one of the hidden objects left
     by the researchers as a clue, they will observe the object, probing it for
     a sense message from the researchers, a code for accessing the next
     object, a sense identity mediated in another sensation. Once the new sense
     identity is ascertained, the player sends this clue to their partner, who
     goes off in search of one of the hidden objects that gives off that sense.
     These clues may come with some information helpful in finding the object
     in space as well as in sense. If the players, who do not know what one
     another look like and most likely have not run into one another at all,
     successfully follow the trail through trust and cooperation, they will
     finally meet at the site of the disappearance.  </p>

     <p> At the end of their trails, the players find themselves together in
     the Room (diagram below). </p>

<div class="text">

    <p> Here, the players encounter a partial, physical manifestation of a
    sense-being. It is seated at a table at the rear of the space, opposite the
    entrance. Its face is masked, and all of its garments are the same color as
    the wall behind it, creating the impression of a vague humanoid form
    against a field of flat color. <em>[Note: as seen in</em> fig. 2<em>, we
        may decide to use a Skype session projected on a third wall instead of
        an actual person in the room; pending further consideration.]</em></p>

    <p>Offset on the same wall to the rear of the sense-being is a writing
    surface—a black or white board—upon which are scrawled three simple words:
    <p>

    <p>“Soothing”<br />
    “Invigorating”<br />
    “Disturbing”<br /></p>

    <p> On either side of the room, facing one another, are two tables,
    arranged symmetrically with identical pairs of items: two laptops, two
    projectors, two musical keyboards, two speakers. </p>

    <p> Each laptop is running a simple slideshow program, filled with a number
    of colored backgrounds that the players will be able to page through at
    their will. Each laptop is connected to a projector on the same table,
    which displays the contents of the screen on the opposite wall. The
    keyboards work in a similar fashion: each player’s keyboard is connected to
    a speaker on the other player’s table. Hence, while the players are not
    facing one another, their manipulations of color and sound affect the
    immediate environment of their partners. </p>

    <p> Before the players begin experimenting with the space, the projectors
    only display the laptops’ screensavers (the test screen for a television
    set); the speakers each play a low, droning note. The sense being does not
    move or speak. No clues are given as to what activity the players must
    engage in. There are only the words on the surface. </p>

    <p> The players’ goal, however, is to cooperatively create 3 affective
    atmospheres, each corresponding to one of the words written on the surface
    behind the sense being. </p>

    <p> They must employ harmonies/dissonances of color and sound created by
    the laptops and keyboards to adequately evoke “soothing,” “invigorating”
    and “disturbing” atmospheres. These atmospheres are silently judged by the
    sense-being. When it is satisfied with an atmosphere, it gets up from its
    chair and crosses out the corresponding word on the writing surface. Once
    the players have achieved every atmosphere, the sense being will put 3
    documents on the table in front of it and silently exit the room… </p>
